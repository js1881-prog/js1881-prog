I work as a Flutter developer at a startup, where I've helped build a high-quality picture-studio platform in collaboration with a talented app designer. Through this experience, I've gained expertise in modern component-based front-end architecture and design patterns that are easily understandable by other developers. I always strive to be the best in what I do.

  
### Research interests
* 🔭 I’m currently interested in backend, especially msa architecture.
* 👋 Aiming to write code that is easy for others to read, based on a deep understanding of technology.
* 📫 Anyone who interests about me, Always welcome to contact me!
