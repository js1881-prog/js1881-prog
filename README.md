## Hi there, I`m Minseok-Kang 👋

* I primarily follow OOP and abstraction, but I embrace functional programming when complexity demands it. I believe that there's no one-size-fits-all approach.
* Based on my experience in fast-paced startups that demand a wide range of skills, I have gained solid knowledge in both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to handle both effectively.
* I believe clean, readable code is just as important as performance. If my code is hard to read, I consider it flawed.
