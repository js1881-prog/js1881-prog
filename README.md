### Hi there, I`m Minseok-Kang 👋

* I generally prefer OOP and abstraction, but I turn to functional programming when things get too complex.
I believe there's no one-size-fits-all solution. KK
* I don't specifically separate learning into front-end and back-end. My experience in startups has given me a broad knowledge encompassing both.
* If the code I write is hard to read, even if it performs well, I consider it to be flawed. I enjoy designing solutions to this issue.


### Career

#### Since 2023~

I work as a Flutter developer at a startup, where I've helped build a high-quality picture-studio platform in collaboration with a talented app designer. Through this experience, I've gained expertise in modern component-based front-end architecture and design patterns that are easily understandable by other developers. I always strive to be the best in what I do.

#### 2024 ~ing

I am currently working at a U.S. startup founded by former Qualcomm members. I manage the integration of our company's products through Flutter apps. As an AI-based company, I am gaining experience in understanding LLM-based architectures, implementing algorithms for maintaining low latency, and increasing test coverage through CI/CD.
  
### Research interests
* 🔭 I’m currently interested in LLM, android.
* 👋 Aiming to write code that is easy for others to read, based on a deep understanding of technology.
* 📫 Anyone who interests about me, Always welcome to contact me!
